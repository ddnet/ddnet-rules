# Moderation Procedure

One of the most important parts of being a Moderator is to truly be dedicated to helping other players out. If a player is asking for assistance you can at least partially provide, do so. Take initiative and make your own decisions. All staff members are expected to exercise common sense at all times while dealing with issues in-game.

*Enforcing the Server rules:*

Note: Only kick/ban players if absolutely necessary. Most issues can be solved simply by talking to them.
You have the right to be more lenient or strict than these guidelines based upon your judgement of the situation and the input of other staff. Marked steps may be ignored. Always give an appropriate reason for banning/kicking unless you have to execute several bans/kicks in succession or the user is known for misbehaviour. Do not issue unreasonably long mute/ban times - in most cases 5 minutes is enough.

*Solving most issues that may arise in-game:*

In case there is an issue not listed above try to resolve it with your best judgment. Communicate with all involved persons and contact other staff if needed.

*Staying up to date about the community - this requires checking the forum on a regular basis:*

Please try to spend at least a few hours per week on the server and 30 minutes on the forums in order to keep up with the community. Most information about user questions can be found in the forum, so make sure to check the important topics.

*Answering general user questions or directing them to the responsible person:*

For most questions there is a subforum where people can address their specific questions or issues. If someone wants to take their question up to a responsible person in private, consider the following list. If the requested topic is not covered, contact an Administrator:
