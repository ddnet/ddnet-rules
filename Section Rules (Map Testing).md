# Section Rules

1. Always be respectful. Never insult mappers or their work. Do not force Testers to test or release your map. Also, respect their suggestions and the time they invested into testing your map. If you do not agree with them, just let them know why.
2. The title of the thread should contain the name of the map, the nickname(s) of the mapper(s), and the server type.
Example:
```
Naufrage by SickCunt [Brutal]
```
3. Do not upload your map on third party websites - use forum attachments instead.
4. Do not open multiple threads for the same map.
5. Do not edit your post if you update your map -  send it within a new post instead, so that Testers are notified about it.
6. The filename of the map should be the actual map name.
7. Do not use an inappropriate map name (insults, etc.).
8. Any kind of description or preview (e.g. screenshots) would be welcome.
9. You are not allowed to have more than **two maps** in *Map Testing* at the same time (*Waiting for mapper* included).

Read and follow the [Mapper Rules](Mapper%20Rules.md) before posting your map.
